Features:
1: easy-to-understand player movement code

2: multi-touch UI buttons for firing, jumping, and reloading 

3: gyroscope controls:
In FPS (First-Person Shooter) mobile games, gyroscope controls allow players to use the device's gyroscope sensor to aim and look around within the game. Instead of relying solely on touch controls or virtual joysticks, gyroscope controls provide an additional method for precise aiming and movement.

4: Joystick sensitivity, or joystick response:
determines how the player character in the game responds to the movement of the joystick. When the joystick is moved slightly, the player character moves slowly or takes small steps. However, when the joystick is moved more aggressively or pushed to its maximum extent, the player character runs or moves at a faster speed.
5: virtual_joystick_for_godot3 by Marco Fazio MIT: 

a virtual joystick that appears on the screen of a mobile device and allows players to control the movement of their in-game character. Instead of using physical buttons or controllers, players can use their fingers to interact with the virtual joystick on the touchscreen.
